# "inventory" file configuration
#
# Rules of inheritance:
#   - "defaults" seciotn parameters are inherited into other sections using the &/* yaml anchor.
#   - parameters defined under router section will override "defaults" section parameters.
#   - inheritance can be removed for a device and all parameters needs to be configured manually.
#
# Supported "driver" types:
#   - ios   : for cisco ios devices
#   - xr    : for cisco ios-xr devices
#   - junos : for juniper devices
#
# Configuration example:
#
# ---
# defaults: &defaults           # "defaults" section
#   run_dir:  running_config/   # default running configuration backup directory, where each device has its own subdirectory
#   state: up                   # state is assumed as "up" by default
#   username: nbmt
#   password: nbmt123
#
# routers:
#   router-1:                   # hostname  # state is inherited from the "defaults" section
#     <<: *defaults             # inheritance from the "defaults" section
#     ip : 10.10.10.1
#     driver : ios
#     username : cisco          # overrides username defined under the "defaults" section
#     password : cisco          # overrides username defined under the "defaults" section
#
#   router-2:                   # hostname  # username and password are inherited from the "defaults" section
#     <<: *defaults             # inheritance from the "defaults" section
#     ip : 10.10.10.2
#     driver : junos
#     state : down              # manual definition overrides the "defaults" section
# 
#   router-3:                   # hostname  # manual definition for all parameters without inheriting from the "defaults" section
#     ip: 10.10.10.3
#     driver: xr
#     state: up
#     username: cisco
#     password: cisco123
#     run_dir:  xr_config/      # changing running configuration backup directory
